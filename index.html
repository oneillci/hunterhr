          <p>
            Well, hello! I’m Elaine, founder of Hunter HR
          </p>
            
          <p>
            I’m passionate about helping small businesses grow. And I love guiding savvy business owners and entrepreneurs toward HR and business success.   
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With over 20 years of HR experience, I founded Hunter HR to empower business owners with the tools, knowledge, and support to take their business to the next level.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Come at me with your people problems, and I’ll find a creative, practical way to solve them
          </p>
          
          <h4>About me:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Don’t let my Irish accent fool you - I’ve found my forever home in beautiful Lake Macquarie. Sorry, you’re stuck with me. </li>
            <li>My three young kids keep me on my toes and laughing every day. But I’m still adjusting to parenthood nine years later. </li>
            <li>Florence from Florence and the Machine is my spirit animal, and ‘You’ve got the love’ is my theme song to life.</li>
            <li>I once graced the cover of Employment Today magazine in New Zealand (stepping in when the actual model didn’t turn up)</li>
          </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="why-choose-us">
      <h2>Why choose us?</h2>

      <p>We know HR can get a bad rap and might even be thought of as the policy police. We’re happy to say that’s not us at all. </p>
      <p>We firmly believe in HR support that’s not all about processes, policies, rules and regulations. While we clear red tape, boost innovation and facilitate constructive change, we don’t take ourselves too seriously, and we tend to have a bit of fun along the way. </p>

      <strong>Our values:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentic</li>
        <li>Accountable</li>
        <!-- <li>Disruptive</li> -->
        <li>Objective</li>
        <li>Fun</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who we work with</h3>
      <p>If you’re a growing small to medium business in Newcastle that employs talented, skilled people, look no further. </p>
      <p>We work across various industries including IT, distribution, property and marketing.  </p>
